# Laylo Pixel - Google Tag Manager Template

## What is the Laylo Pixel?

The Laylo Pixel lets you easily track conversion events (like ticket purchases or event check-ins) in order to create smarter messaging segments. Laylo also uses this data to enrich your fan profiles and provide more detailed and meaningful analytics.

The Laylo Pixel can be used on any website and has many different integration methods.

## Google Tag Manager Integration

To provide the easiest setup for our users we've created a Community Template that will allow you to add the Laylo Pixel to your website in a few clicks.

To install the Laylo Pixel, go to Google Tag Manager and click "Tags" in the left hand navigation.

Click the "New" button in the top right.

Click "Tag Configuration"

Click "Discover more tag types in the Community Template Gallery"

Search for "Laylo" and click "Laylo Pixel". Then click "Choose Template".

There are two fields to fill out. You can find your Laylo User ID at https://laylo.com/settings?tab=Integrations. For source, put the ticketing platform or website that this pixel will be fired on.

Then click "Triggering" and select "Initialization - All Pages".

Click "Save" and give the tag the name "Laylo Pixel".

That's it! The Laylo Pixel will now run wherever your Google Tag Manager lives.

## User consent

Since the data that the Laylo Pixel collects is used to identify and message users' we automatically check to see if you have granted consent via Google Tag Manager. We specifically check to see if "ad_user_data" has been granted. If it has, then we allow data to be sent back to Laylo.
